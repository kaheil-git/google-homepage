This is just a mini project to enhance my nonexistent coding skills! Project should be about modifying the google homepage. 

I'm contemplating on naming it Gooble. 

As for my current skill set, I'm still struggling and googling things every single time around. Such as how to open a text editor through the terminal, how to make a file directory, etc.. wish me luck tho! WOO KEEP PLOWING THRU. 



UPDATE//

Gooble did not happen. This was super hard and things kept on moving around the page when I went to work on a new part of the webpage.... I learned a decent amount but I am still a super noob. I hope I'll get better! 

Also, I tried doing the footer but I essentially gave up... T_T sad. But I did what I could!
